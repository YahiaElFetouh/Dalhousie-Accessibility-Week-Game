# CLT Accessibility Week Game Fall 2022



## Initial Problem

From November 27th to December 3rd is Accessibility Week at Dalhousie University. This year the Center for Learning and Teaching would like to spread awareness and educate people on the topic of accessibility and disabilities with 7 short online games. Our team has been tasked with fulfilling this goal.  

We will be building a new game from scratch to address and educate accessibility and disabilities. This product is expected to be built, delivered and deployed on a tight timeframe as well due to it being intended for use during Dalhousie’s Accessibility Week, which will be on Week 13 of the academic school year. 


It’s more important than ever that our team plan extensively on our approach in delivering a product to the client that meets their expectations. This document will outline the project in more detail highlighting its stakeholders, risks & our team's proposal and plan to bring our client's vision to life.

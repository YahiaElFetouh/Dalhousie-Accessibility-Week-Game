# CLT Accessibility Week Game Fall 2022

## Welcome!
Welcome to the CLT Accessibility Week Game Source Code Directory! Within this file is a quick small walkthrough to set things up, provide an overview of the projects purpose and provide a list of resources and references used in developing this project. 
This project was first initially launched in September 2022 and is set to release its first release including 3 games by November 27th, 2022.


## Project Purpose
From November 27th to December 3rd 2022 is Accessibility Week at Dalhousie University. This year the Center for Learning and Teaching would like to spread awareness and educate people on the topic of accessibility and disabilities with 7 short online games.
(Excerpt taken from our Initial Project Plan under the section 'Initial Problem')


## Initial (Unity) Project Setup:
1. Clone this GitLab repo. onto your local device (git clone [Gitlab Repo HTTPS Link])
2. Open the cloned project on Unity and let it compile the project on your device
3. Once project has compiled and opened and no issues are present on console then you are all good to go to start/continue collaborating on this project!
    - In case any issues are encountered refer to 'Guidance on Avoiding Potential Encounter-able Unity Project Issues' below!
    - Under Assets/Scenes/Gameplay Mechanics. This directory comprosises of scenes we developed and tested around with in our initial stages of developing this game. The have been collected here to help future teams to build and test with.


## Guidance on Avoiding Potential Encounter-able Unity Project Issues:
- Depending on your Team size it is recomended to use Plastic over GitLab or GitHub as it can handle Unity errors efficiently. However if sticking with Gitlab just ensure that proper version control is followed
- Unity Scenes are the most suseptible to conflict errors so communication of what is being changed and considering that in resolving merge conflicts is vital
- Lessons learned: 100's of files can be changed over time, keep things small and logically compact; that is to say avoid wide sweeping changes and in long periods of time to avoid merge conflicts
